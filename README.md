# interleave-pdf

A simple Python program for interleaving pdf documents (inserting blank pages inbetween the regular printed leaves).

It was motivated by the desire to print lecture notes on a landscape a4 page with the pdf content on one side and blank space to take notes during lectures on the other. This is something not usually achievable using normal printer drivers. Once the document is interleaved all that is required is selecting landscape orientation and choosing two (or four) pages per sheet.

Requires PyPDF2 for the pdf operations and tkinter for the GUI.
